##Thoughts on Configuration Management

Configuration management allows teams of developers to create and maintain complex software systems over time. This skill is very important for all software developers so effective changes to code can be produced within a team. If a developer is working alone, configuration management is needed less because the skill is used for managing changes from different sources while keeping the code from breaking.

##My Experience with Configuration Management

Personally, I have never had a problem with configuration management. Almost all of my class projects up to this point have been individual-based work. The only two classes that I took during my time in college so far that required group work were the introductory course, ICS 111, and the databases course, ICS 321. For ICS 111, we used the EZ.java file that was provided to us to aide in our coding so it was easy to merge our code together. I was emailed everyone's completed code, which we all worked on different parts, and put them together in a folder in Eclipse in which I created the main. For ICS 321, my partner and I met up when we could and worked on the coding together.

##Git and Why it is Popular

I think that git is popular because of Github. Github is a free hosting service for anyone who wants to upload their code to the internet where they can have a team work on it. There are also many other distributed version control systems available for use that could be equally effective as git. Each version control system has its own advantages and disadvantages like git, but not all version control systems have free repository hosting.
