## Software Engineering and Me

### Interests in Software Engineering
  When I was younger, I never really had any thought of being a software engineer. When I went on the computer, I downloaded many applications to play with. In middle school, I found a class that taught basic website development in HTML. We learned how to create a HTML file out of a text editor with the head, title, and body of the HTML file. I also used to play a lot of online games (Flash games), which had code below the game so people could embed the game on their own websites. From that class, my interest in software engineering ignited.
  Now, I still like website development, but I feel like a lot of website developers use templates to make their lives easier. Also, CSS helps a lot to mitigate formatting in the HTML code. I also like Javascript because it is simple to learn. The main thing that I am interested is phone applications. Smart phones make everyone's lives easier because of all of its functions. I like finding new applications on that app store that can help in daily life. For example, I found an app that can translate based off of a person's voice instead of typing.
  
## Development for the Future
  Right now, I am working through classes to learn langauges that give me a great foundation for coding. I hope to be able to use the foundation that I am revceiving to learn different languages that I can use to solve problems. I also would like to be able to nurture my communication skills through applications such as slack or GitHub. Many classes that we need to take require group work, so these tools will help me elevate my ability to communicate. I would also like to gain the ability to work in high stress situations so that I can think in rough situations and meet my deadlines. Software engineering is definitely going to help me in the future, and I will make sure that I use what I learn from my classes to escalate my abilities.
