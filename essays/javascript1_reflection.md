This is my first time learning Javascript. Overall, the programming language, so far, is simple enough to understand. I had previously programmed using Java, C, and C++ before which is very similar to Javascript. The previously mentioned programming languages are very similar. The formatting for loops, function definitions and calls, and many other parts of Javascript are especially similar to Java. The only difference that majorly impacts the way I view Javascript is the way that variables are assigned. In Java, there are different types of variables such as float, int, and double. In Javascript all variables can be created using let for variables that change within the code and cons for the variables that stay the same. Overall, Javascript seems easier to use than most of the other programming languages that I have dealt with.

From a software engineering perspective, Javascript is a great programming language. The language itself is very simple and intuitive. It is mostly used for web browsers and applications, although it is also used for UI work. Javascript is also still evolving. The javascript used back in the 1990's is much different as it is now. For example, although var can be used to declare variables, we do not use var to declare variables. The use of var is currently looked down upon in modern Javascript because let and cons are the current norm. My last reason for Javascript being a good programming language from a software engineering perspective is 
that we are learning the language for the software engineering class, which means that there are positives to learning the language.
    
Athletic software engineering is an interesting topic. Competing against other people at coding is intense because it forces whoever is competing to practice a lot to keep up. All of the prompts that we practiced with had me struggling. I was unable to finish both Euler practice WODs before the time limit. The WODs were useful because it allowed me to finish the class WOD within the average finish time. Using the WODs to practice for real interviews is stressful because it presses us to think and be on our toes during the sessions. So far, the process isn't enjoyable unless I am able to finish the code. It feels good to know that the code that I produced was correct. I am unsure if practicing in this manner will produce a better outcome than practicing with a different method because of the small sample pool to see if it matches the way that I learn.
