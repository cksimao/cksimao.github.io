## A Falling Meteor
Learning Meteor takes a lot of time and effort. Trying to learn as much as possible of Meteor was like getting hit on the head with “a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth’s atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light.” Using Meteor was frustrating in many aspects.

Using Meteor was difficult because there were many files that were needed to be sorted through while creating the website. There were files on the client and server sides, imported files, api files, and more. On top of that, in many of the index files, import calls were needed for each file that was being used by the index.js file in each of the main folders. The thing I disliked the most is that with one mistake, the whole website can crash and loses its ability to run.

There were also easy parts of using Meteor. I liked the refresh aspect for when changes were made in the code. The website automatically included the changes onto the live site. Also, there were templates for a lot of the code that I needed to create the website. It was very simple to set up the app itself and download all of the necessary files to begin coding.

Meteor was cool because it used the terminal to run its server-side functions. The app is set up using the terminal and downloading all the necessay files for the meteor server. It was also interesting because more than one page could be created in the app. Instead of only having one html file for one page, there were different files for multiple pages within one app.

Overall, my first impression of Meteor is that it is an okay application architecture. It has all of the functionalities to create a working app. The problems with Meteor are the speed, the initial learning curve, and the loadability of the project if there are errors. It is hard to evaulate how the app is working when the website does not load at all.
