For this project, we had to make a bank application that was the same as our previous bank application, except we programmed it with C++. This program is a bank application that I had to code for ICS 212 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The application took the account number, name, addresses, and birth year of the customer who uses it. The main key for the project was the account number. We used an interface so that the user could add, remove, modify, and print user info by person or all at once.

Once again, this project was an individual project. I had to convert all of the C language input and output code into C++ input and output.

I learned how to code a little bit in C++ with this project. It was interesting to see the differences between C and C++ through the conversions in this project.
