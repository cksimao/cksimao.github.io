This project was that final project for ICS 111. We worked in groups to create a video of objects moving around the screen. The project uses txt files to give directions on how the objects on the screen should move.

I was in charge of creating the video which can be seen here(https://youtu.be/jx2UC2_bxx4) 
I also made the code for cksimao_animator which can be found here(https://github.com/cksimao/projectcodes/blob/master/cksimao_Animator.java)
I also helped organizing the main(https://github.com/cksimao/projectcodes/blob/master/main.java).

With this project, we learned how to work in groups to create a project and had to present in front of a large group.
