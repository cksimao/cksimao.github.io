Math With Friends is an application that allows users to play against others to improve their math skills. In the game, players are prompted with a math expression. If the expression is true, then the user should move their character to the upper half of the screen. If the expression is false, then they move the character to the bottom of the screen. If the answer is wrong, the user loses. The first user to reach the goal wins.

I contributed to the project through communication and making sure that the repo didn't have unnecessary files. I also implemented some code within the application, including a sample form of a profile page.

There are many things that I learned from working on this project. I learned how to work in teams using Slack for communication and GitHub as the means of sharing our work. I also learned more about how to use Meteor as well as coding in Javascript and HTML. The main thing that I learned is to make sure to work on things incrementally.
