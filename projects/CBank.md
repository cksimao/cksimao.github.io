This program is a bank application that I had to code for ICS 212 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The application had to be made with the C programming language. The application took the account number, name, addresses, and birth year of the customer who uses it. The main key for the project was the account number. We used an interface so that the user could add, remove, modify, and print user info by person or all at once.

The project was an individual project so I did everything. It was very time consuming having to figure out all the right uses of code to produce the program.

I learned how to problem solve quite a bit with this project. I had a lot of bugs in it at first, so I had to look for what I was doing wrong during my testing and fix them. I learned how to code better in C and I learned how to use linked lists within C.
